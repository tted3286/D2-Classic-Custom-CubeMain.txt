Except for the guides, the txt files within go in "Diablo II\data\global\excel".  This softmod was conceived both with basemod(without MPQ),plugy and D2 DX graphic wrapper(The Best); thus once files are in place, I launch game with shortcut to game.exe with the following parameters: "D:\Diablo II\Game.exe" -3dfx -direct -txt
Of particular importance is "-direct -txt".  Without these, softmods don't work.
This is just to give someone an idea of how to use softmods if they have no clue.
I will update CubeMain.txt at my discretion, but I have I think, all the recipes that I want, but I will surely come up with more.
